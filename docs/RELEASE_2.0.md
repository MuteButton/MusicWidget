# OnCue 2.0

The updated 2.0 build uses version code 18 and application ID
`io.github.mutebutton.oncue`. It retains the current OnCue signing certificate,
so it installs over the previous version-code-17 OnCue build without resetting
settings. Much older installs with a different certificate require reinstalling;
see [signing reset](SIGNING_RESET.md).

This update clarifies notification access and recommends unrestricted background
battery usage for more reliable timestamps on all devices, with Samsung-specific
navigation instructions. It also adds Android 7 fallback launcher icons and
checks for mismatched widget resource overrides. Widget appearance and playback
logic are unchanged. Android 12+ defaults to a 4-by-1 widget.

Verification of this update focuses on setup, settings links, resources, and a
physical Samsung widget smoke check. The previous APK passed 170 emulator checks;
that full suite is not claimed as rerun on this APK. See the release attachment
`VERIFICATION.txt` for its exact identity and validation scope.

See [known limitations](KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md) for battery and accessibility
boundaries. Historical 1.0 remains on release/1.0.
